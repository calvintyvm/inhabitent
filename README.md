<H1> Inhabitent </h1>




<p> Inhabitent was a project done with WordPress as the CMS. </p>
<p> Inhabitent is a fully fletched blog site with many features such as a Shopping catalouge with
    links directly into the products with a full description on what it is and a blogging catalogue that enables
    people to comment with. </p>
    
<h1> What I used </h1>
<p> Inhabitent was mainly styled with CSS/SASS, HTML and the server side coding was done with PHP. </p>

<h1> What I learned </h1>
<p> Inhabitent was a really fun and great project as I learned how to fully build widgets from boilerplates, 
    work in an environment in which the knowledge is applicable to the modern tech industry and finally I worked with Wordpres.
  
<h1> What I can do better </h1>
<p> Doing this project, I realized that I have not fully understood SASS. Although I think I do, I found myself just using CSS and only using the nesting features from SASS. I will try my best to fully understand SASS so that the next time I have a project, this will not happen again </p>
